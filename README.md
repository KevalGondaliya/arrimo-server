# How to run Nodejs app

need to run cmd:

yarn

yarn start

Here we manage 2 roles one is admin and the second is user.
now, only the admin can create a user.
so when you set up a project first time in your system and run the above command, it creates one particular admin. and the credential is:

email: admin@gmail.com
password: 123456

After this, you can change your email as an admin and also you can create a user.

and the user can create an event.
