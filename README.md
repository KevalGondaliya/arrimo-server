# Getting Started with nodejs App

need to run cmd:

yarn
yarn start

Here we manage 2 rolles one is admin and second is user.
now, only admin can create a user.
so when you setup project first time in your system and run the above command, it's created a onr perticular admin. and the credential is:

email: admin@gmail.com
password: 123456

After this you can change you email as a admin and also you can create a user.

and user can create a event.
